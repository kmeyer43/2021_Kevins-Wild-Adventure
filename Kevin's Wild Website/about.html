    <h1>Welcome to the website that is dedicated to Kevin's Wild Adventure.</h1><br>
    <h2></h2>
    
    <p>We are a rag-tag team of students brought together by random chance. We all come from many different backgrounds <br>
    and lifestyles. We are an ambitious team and took on the challenge of putting together the worlds best video game. <br>
    Okay maybe not the best game in the world but it will at least be amusing to our instructor... Hopefully!</p>
